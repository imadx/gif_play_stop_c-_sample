# Play and Pause GIF animations with C#
This is an example of a minimal implementation for playing and stopping GIF animations with Visual Studio C#

## How to use

To use this, you can use your own GIF animation. But make sure to set a proper timer interval.  
What this does is simply enabling/disabling the PictureBox so that the source image plays/stops.
